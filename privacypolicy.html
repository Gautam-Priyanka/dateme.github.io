                        <p class="contentwhoyouare">When the User uses the Datsme app, the following information is collected by Datsme</p>
                        <h4 class="whoyouheading">a) Data from the activity</h4>

                        <p class="contentwhoyouare">This is the data collected from the use of Application by the User. It consists of data such as the date of registration of the User with Datsme, the last use of the Datsme app and data that tells us about the number of interactions of the user on the app (like the no. of friend requests received/sent), the third party accounts (such as Facebook and Google+) connected to your account and the digital transactions that are performed by the User on the Datsme app( for example the subscription of premium services).</p>

                        <h4 class="whoyouheading">b) Location
</h4>

                        <p class="contentwhoyouare">Location is the central tenet of the Datsme app. Users need to be visible on the map for the other users to find them. To ensure the privacy of the Users, Datsme has two major features:</p>
                        <p class="contentwhoyouare">1.The Users are grouped into clusters (as far as possible) ensuring that the location of one specific User is not exposed.</p>
                        <p class="contentwhoyouare">2.In case the User is at an isolated location and cannot be grouped into a cluster, an additional safety feature has been provided i.e. the limiting of the zoom level of the map. This is done so that any other User may not be able to decipher the exact location of the User easily.</p>
                        <p class="contentwhoyouare">By using the Datsme app, you are giving us your consent to use your exact location. You can revoke this consent by choosing to disable the location feature on your Smartphone, in which case your last location will be displayed on the map. If the User wishes to remove himself/herself from the map, he can proceed to the “Take a break” option in the settings page of the Datsme app. In this case, the User won't be able to Use any of the features of the Datsme app and the User won't have any presence on the Datsme app.</p>
                        <h4 class="whoyouheading">c) Transaction data</h4>
